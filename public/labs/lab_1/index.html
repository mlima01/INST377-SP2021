    <h1>Melissa Lima's Lab 1</h1>
    <p>First, the basics.</p>
    
    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    
    <p>Headings set your default page size</p>
    
    <p>Add your four mochi images from your tutorial here.</p>
    
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    
    <p>Let's make an unordered list.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS underpins most user interfaces now.</li>
        <li>CSS tries something so hard no other computer language even bothers.</li>
        <li>Javascript got popular from having a runtime in every browser in the world.</li>
    </ul>
    
    And now, one in order.
    
    Add an ordered list element.
    Add your top five music albums in order to the list.
    Check it out, numbers by default.
    
    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    
    Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.
    
    Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.
    
    Sometimes you want to do both.
    
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    
    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
    
    Add a hard line under here.
    
    This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.
